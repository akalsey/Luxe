**L**ogin **U**ser e**X**perience **E**nhancements (pronounced like "ducks").

A better User Experience for Drupal login and signup. Gets rid of the tabs, adds a password recovery 
link to the login form, gives a split-screen "login or register" on the login screen. Configuration 
allows you to easily change titles, and edit text. The new login page is completely themeable.

Don't like the way it looks? The new login page is completely themeable. 
Just copy the included template into your theme,
rename it to luxe-login.tpl.php, and change anything you'd like.
